# City Car on Road movement
## CSS Positioning

- change css file after reading comments to get similar results to the image, first position them then animate them
- give parent and children approperiate positioning so children could move relative to the parent
- add hover effect (use positioning related properties not transform!!) so car moves from right to left
- can you make the care move full width without getting out of screen?
- add hover effect to change city background image
- Bonus: you can use this as a part in a car dealer website !!
