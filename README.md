# City Car on Road movement
## CSS Positioning

- change css file after reading comments to get similar results to the image or check the page link and try to hover over the city and road, first position the road and car pictures then animate car and the background
- give parent and children the approperiate positioning so children could move relative to the parent
- add hover effect (use positioning related properties not transform!!) so car moves from right to left
- can you make the care move full width without getting out of screen?
- add hover effect to change city background image
- Bonus: you can use this as a part in a car dealer website !!
